# MeningoTPP Dashboard

This repository contains the code for creating the Dash application [https://meningotpp.herokuapp.com/](https://meningotpp.herokuapp.com/). The Dash application summarizes the expected impact of using a rapid diagnostic test to trigger reactive vaccination campaign against *Neisseria meningitidis* for a population of 1,000,000 individuals over a period of 6 months.  

The custom codes for **MeningoPATAT**, a microsimulation model that was used to model the spread of *Neisseria meningitidis* can be found in the [meningopatat](./meningopatat/) folder.
